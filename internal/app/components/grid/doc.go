// Package grid provides grid-based navigation functionality for Neru.
//
// This package implements a comprehensive visual grid overlay system that allows users
// to navigate and click anywhere on the screen using keyboard input. Unlike accessibility
// tree-based approaches, the grid system works universally across all applications by
// dividing the screen into cells, making it the most reliable navigation method in Neru.
