// Package hints provides accessibility tree-based hint generation and navigation.
//
// This package implements a comprehensive hint-based navigation system that queries the
// accessibility tree to find clickable elements and overlays them with keyboard hints
// (similar to Vimium for browsers). It serves as one of the two primary navigation
// methods in Neru, complementing the grid-based approach.
