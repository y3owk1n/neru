// Package electron provides enhanced accessibility support for Electron-based applications,
// enabling proper UI element detection in applications that don't properly expose their
// interface to the macOS accessibility API by default.
//
// This package implements a specialized solution for Electron, Chromium, and Firefox-based
// applications that suffer from accessibility limitations. Many modern applications built
// with these frameworks don't expose complete accessibility information, making standard
// accessibility-based navigation difficult or impossible.
