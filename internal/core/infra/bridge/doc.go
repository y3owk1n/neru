// Package bridge provides comprehensive Go bindings for Objective-C APIs used in the Neru application,
// enabling seamless integration with macOS system frameworks for accessibility, hotkeys, and overlay functionality.
//
// This package serves as the critical bridge between Go and macOS native APIs, implementing CGo wrappers
// around Objective-C code to provide access to system-level functionality that is not available through
// standard Go libraries. It is the foundation for all macOS-specific integration in Neru.
